# CryptoClustering

In this assignment, I used python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

This assignment involved:
    - scaling of data (to have better ways compare the data when values are originally very different from one another)
    - building new dataframes with scaled data
    - computing and ploting an elbow curve for visually analzing potential k values
    - running k-means following model, fit, predict procedures
    - plotting scatter plots with predictions data
    - running a pca analysis to better optimize clusters
    - compare and contrast the use of fewer features to cluster data using k-means
